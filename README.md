## Installation

Open [the latest release](https://github.com/ccmdi/mma/releases/latest) and download the installer for your platform.

### macOS / Linux

On macOS, you will likely need to run:
```zsh
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Map Making App.app"
```

On both Mac & Linux, framerate and rendering stability can be an issue. If you encounter these problems, you can [run the app in a browser](#run-in-a-browser). The web version will eventually be a first-class launch option, but is only available from source for now.

### From source

```bash
cd app && npm install && cargo tauri build
```

Requires: Rust toolchain, Node.js, npm.

### Run in a browser

Serve the app locally and open it in any browser:

```bash
cd app && npm install && npm run build
cargo run --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml --features web-serve -- --serve
```

Then open the printed `http://127.0.0.1:1430`.
