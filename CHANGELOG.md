## v0.5.0 — 2026-05-29

**Plugins & marketplace**
- **Plugin marketplace** with two tabs — Core (bundled) and Additional (fetched from GitHub). Install/uninstall downloads or deletes plugin files in app data; enable/disable is separate, so you can deactivate a plugin without removing it. Manually-installed plugins show up too.
- **Shared modules** — plugins can now import app-bundled libraries (React, deck.gl, luma.gl) instead of bundling their own copies.
- New **heatmap** plugin
- New **gradient coloring** plugin — colors markers by any field. Numeric/date fields get range buckets, categorical fields get one color per value.
- New **pivot table analytics** plugin — cross-tabulates your selection (active, saved, or all) against any field or tags.
- New **sun position** plugin — computes sun azimuth and altitude for each location from its coordinates and capture time.

**Editor**
- **Multi-window editing** — open maps in separate windows.
- **Time-of-day filtering** in the date picker — date fields get an optional time input, and a new "Any date" mode lets you filter purely by time of day.
- **Country select improvements** faster, and offers downloadable higher-accuracy border datasets — High (~10MB) and Ultra (~46MB), selectable under Street View settings.
- **Fit bounds on paste** — optionally reframe the map to the locations you just pasted.
- **Minimum search radius** map setting (10–500m slider) controlling the floor for Street View lookups.
- **Driving-direction enrichment** — new metadata field for the capture-time driving direction.

**Performance**
- Much faster selections on large maps — selecting everything on a 1M-location map is now near-instant (~435ms → ~16ms).

**Fixes**
- Fixed the auto-updater 404 and missing macOS update signatures in the release workflow.
- Fixed road/link heading reading the wrong protobuf field
- Fixed several date picker bugs: bare month parsing, value conversion when toggling any-year/any-time, persistence across navigation, and a year grid (2007–now).
- Fixed a plugin activation race (plugins now wait for the map to be ready), gave the toolbar a deterministic order, fixed a marketplace double-click, and hardened plugin install against path traversal.
- Replaced native confirm() dialogs in Version History and the Seen dialog with inline click-to-confirm
- Fixed the fullscreen tag bar: visible input text color, spellcheck off, and an input-filtered palette.
- Narrowed the Alt keybinding block so it only catches genuine navigation conflicts instead of all Alt combos.
- Hid the scrollbar in the map overview.
